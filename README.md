npm-plugin
==========

*npm-plugin* is a very basic `sbt` plugin to generate and publish Scala.js libraries as `npm` packages at `npmjs.org`. Any `npm` library dependencies that your library has will be handled correctly.

Usage
-----

Add the following lines to your `plugins.sbt`

    resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("edadma", "sbt-plugins")
    addSbtPlugin("xyz.hyperreal" % "npm-plugin" % "0.1.4")
    
Tasks
-----

The plugin provides two tasks

### `npmPackage`

This task builds a valid `npm` package in `target/npm` which it creates if not there. It uses settings from your build settings as well as the `package.json` generated by the compiler.

`npmPackage` assumes that you have executed both a `run` command and a `fullOptJS` command to get the compiler to generate everything needed to build an `npm` package, and that the `name` and `version` settings in your `build.sbt` won't conflict with any existing package on `npmjs.org`.


### `npmPublish`

This task starts by executing `npmPackage`, so if you've tested your library locally, in Scala, and your ready to publish to the JavaScript/TypeScript world, just type this command (Making sure your test `Main` doesn't run when your library is imported into a TypeScript file.
